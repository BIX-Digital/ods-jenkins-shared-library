stageDeployToOpenshift deploys the service.

A deployment is more than just updating an image, it might also involve adding
an environment variable, or changing constraints etc. Because of this, a
deployment should be one atomic JSON patchset.

When an "openshift" folder is present, we use the "tailor" binary in the
slave-base to apply its templates. The behaviour is customizable by
adding a "Tailorfile" (or a more specific, per-project version of it).

The actual rollout is triggered explicitly, which also allows us to
monitor the progress and fail the build if the rollout does not work.

As a consequence of this, when adding an "openshift" folder, the
automatic triggers are removed, and the built container image is not
tagged with "latest" anymore - we simply deploy the tag we just applied.
This assumes that the template consumes the TAGVERSION param and that it
uses it correctly to set the image. The latter is not checked, but the
former at least errors if the TAGVERSION param is not consumed.
